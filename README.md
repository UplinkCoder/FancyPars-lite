# FancyPars-lite

currently unfinished but hopefully useful to someone.
-
it only compiles with dmd 2.066.1 because it exploits a bug in the const-ness type-system
to do technically illegal things in CTFE
-

Please note, that FancyPars is tailored to fit my needs for transcompilers
It might not be applicable as a general parser generator
